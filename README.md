# MrSanchezCSE_Class
Repository for the 2nd period Mr Sanchez CSE class
this is the first time I add information to the readme file
I am adding a second line but I want to add a line from another contributor
I will try to add a new line to this readmefile using my other account gerardosanchez
Perfect it looks like I am on the right path to make changes I will add this line of code to the readme file from the master file and see if I can just see it without doing anything
this new line of code will be not written directly but instead will be creating a new branch and start a pull request
new line of code written by master copy
I will start this line on gsanch15 and commit directly to the master branch
Now this new line will test the create new branch and start a pull request
